They take the listener on a new sonic journey, reflecting their evolving musical vision. They are constantly experimenting to create something exciting and meaningful for the audience and are always striving to exceed the boundaries of what’s possible for them.

                <PopularSongs desc={"Our popular tracks come from \"In Control\", our latest EP. \"In Control\" is a collection of 6 pop songs with elements of funk and psychedelia sprinkled all over it. From the driving 80’s inspired electronic drums, clean funk rhythm guitar and the swelling synthesizers of “Through the Motions”, to the smooth bass guitar riffs, groovy conga rhythms and ambient keys of “No More Love”, each song displays a new sound pallet and thematically, provides a new perspective on the emotional effects of a significant other. The EP dives into how someone may manipulate your mind either positively or negatively in ways you may or may not be able to control."}/>
